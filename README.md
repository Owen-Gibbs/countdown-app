# Countdown App

The Countdown App is a responsive web application designed to provide users with a simple and interactive way to count down to a specific date and time. This app is ideal for tracking events like sports fixtures, deadlines, or any significant upcoming event. It features a user-friendly interface that allows users to input a date and time of their choice, which the app then uses to calculate the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the event occurs.

One of the key functionalities of the app is its dynamic countdown display. Once a date is entered, the countdown begins automatically, updating in real-time every second. The app is designed to be visually appealing and easy to use, with large, clear numbers for each time unit (days, hours, minutes, and seconds), making it easy to keep track of time.
